# GoodChat

Project work for the WebRTC exam.

GoodChat is a WebChat (real time) developed using the MERN stack:
- Mongodb
- Express.JS
- React.JS
- Node.js

Other tools were used:
- Redux.js, in order to give better responsiveness to the application.
- Postman, for testing of the APIs.
- Cloudinary, whose API was used for the upload of the images used as profile pictures by users.
